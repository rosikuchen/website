					• "Introduction to particle physics" - 38C3 Hamburg
					<br>
					<br>
					I'll explain the fundamentals of the Standard Model of particle physics, provide insights into experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and demonstrate the role that particles like the Higgs boson and neutrinos play. The focus is on making particle physics understandable and accessible—no prior knowledge required, but plenty of room for questions.
					This talk is aimed at anyone who wants to learn more about the basic building blocks of matter and the work of modern physicists. Whether you're at school, university, or simply interested in science—you've come to the right place!
